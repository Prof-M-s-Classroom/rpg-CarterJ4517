1 | Your spaceship lands gently at the bottom of a sunken canyon. Around you is a network of sandstone pillars that tower above, almost blocking out the sun.\nDo you head 1) north, or 2) south? | 2 | 3
2 | As you head north, you spot a small concrete structure sticking out of the canyon wall, surrounded by heavy industrial equipment. Getting closer, you can see a steel door on\nthe side of the building.\nDo you 1) go inside, or 2) turn around to head south? | 4 | 3
3 | You explore the south end of the canyon, finding a shallow ditch. Below, there is a concrete wall with a red door labeled "FIRE EXIT".\nDo you 1) enter the door or 2) try going north? | 5 | 2
4 | You enter the room with the steel door. Across the room, there is a stairwell behind a locked door.\nThere are two other passages, do you head for 1) the storage room or 2) the factory floor? | 9 | 5
5 | You step into a room full of chains, pulleys, and belts. It appears to be some sort of factory. The fire exit is connected to this room. In the corner of the dark room, you\nspot a pair of bright white eyes.\nDo you 1) step closer to investigate or 2) go to leave the room? | 6 | 7
6 | The eyes follow you as you step closer, and then seem to shuffle away deeper into the building.\nDo you 1) follow after them or 2) take this opportunity to exit to the steel door room? | 8 | 4
7 | You turn to the passage leading to the steel door room. As you're about to exit, long black fingers cover your face, and the monster snaps your neck.\nYou have died. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | -1 | -1
8 | You follow after the creature, hoping for a better look. As you corner it, you can see that it's a tall black humanoid made out of what appears to be plant matter. Your\napproach angers it, and it lunges forward, grabbing and strangling you.\nYou have died. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | -1 | -1
9 | You enter a room of mostly empty shelving units. In one corner is what looks like a giant insect, crouched over and apparently defending a small key.\nDo you 1) smack the bug with a stop sign you found on the ground or 2) toss it a hairbrush from one of the shelves? | 10 | 11
10 | You give the bug a solid whack with the stop sign. It springs up, revealing a set of wings that it uses to take off and chase after you.\nCatching you in a corner, it attacks you viciously, and you die from you injuries. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | -1 | -1
11 | The hairbrush lands at the feet of the insect. It contemplates the offering, then picks it up with its pincers and scurries away, leaving the key.\nYou take the key and return to the steel door room. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | 12 | 12
12 | As soon as you enter the steel door room, you find yourself face-to-face with a gigantic spider.\nDo you 1) grab the stop sign from earlier and attack the spider or 2) try to jump over it to reach the locked door? | 13 | 14
13 | Whacking the spider with all your might, it shrivels up and dies after you hit it a few times. This leaves a clear path to the locked door, which you open with the key.\nYou step into the stairwell. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | 15 | 15
14 | You charge at the spider, gracefully leaping over it right before it can attack your legs. Unfortunately, you land in one of its webs, and the spider catches you.\nYou're spun into the spider's web, unable to escape as it saves you for its next meal... (type '1' or '2' to continue) | -1 | -1
15 | You go up the stairs and find that it connects to a hallway. You can hardly see in this room, as its full of steam and the lights are out.\nDo you 1) feel around for a valve to shut off the steam or 2) trudge through to find the other end? | 16 | 17
16 | Feeling along the hallway wall, your hands find a handle which you then twist. A hissing sound stops and the steam slowly dissipates. The clear air reveals a landmine in\nthe center of the hallway. You carefully hug the wall to slip by... (type '1' or '2' to continue) | 18 | 18
17 | You walk down the hallway with your arms out to feel for any walls. Without seeing where you're walking, you step on a short ledge and hear a click.\nYou are blown to bits by the landmine before you can realize what you just stepped on. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | -1 | -1
18 | At the end of the hallway is another door, which leads to a new room. Inside is glowing yellow device that appears to be plugged into a large machine. You remove the\ndevice carefully, which causes a shower of sparks and all the lights in the building to shut off. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | 19 | 19
19 | With the device, you step out of the room.\nYou can either 1) follow the hallway back to the stairwell or 2) leap down from a catwalk above the factory room. | 20 | 24
20 | You reach the top of the stairwell, but see a viscous cyan slime draped over the steps leading down. It wasn't there before...\nDo you 1) carefully step down the stairs or 2) jump down from the upper landing? | 21 | 22
21 | Your boots squish as you step into the slime. On the way down, you slip and fall backwards, covering you in the goo. You try to stand up, but the slime puts up a fight,\npinning you down.\nUnable to escape, the goo slowly dissolves you... (type '1' or '2' to continue) | -1 | -1
22 | Avoiding the goo, you jump off the railing to the ground below. You land with a loud thud and almost drop the glowing apparatus.\nYou find your balance and step into the steel door room. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | 23 | 23
23 | You are in the steel door room.\nYou can either 1) leave through the steel door or 2) enter the factory room. | 28 | 24
24 | You find yourself in the factory room.\nYou can choose to 1) push through the darkness to the fire exit or 2) enter the steel door room. | 25 | 23
25 | On your way to the fire exit, do you: 1) keep an eye out that you're not being followed or 2) scan the room above you? | 26 | 27
26 | You walk towards the fire exit, periodically checking behind you. Just as you're about to make it, something heavy lands on your head, covering your face.\nUnable to breath under the writhing mass, you suffocate and pass out. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | -1 | -1
27 | Your eyes are fixed on the machinery suspended above your path to the fire exit. Through the chains, you spot something suspicious -- a centipede-like creature watching\nyou from the ceiling.\nYou play it safe and take the long way to the fire exit. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | 31 | 31
28 | The heavy steel door slams shut behind you. You're back outside, but it's dark now, and something feels... off... You should get back to the ship quickly.\nDo you 1) take the high ground to look for the ship or 2) lie low on your way back? | 29 | 30
29 | You climb a nearby mound to spot the ship, and find it's light bouncing around a bend in the canyon. But before you can head that way, you hear heavy footsteps behind you.\nYou spot a giant creature stomping your way. You try to run, but it grabs you and shoves you in its mouth. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | -1 | -1
30 | You hunch over and dart between low ditches, afraid of what might be out there. Your paranoia pays off when you spot a giant creature... which apparently hasn't spotted you.\nYou make it back to the ship safely. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | 34 | 34
31 | The thin door of the fire exit quietly closes behind you. You're back outside, but it's dark now, and your flashlight is almost out of battery.\nDo you 1) jog to the ship or 2) cautiously walk there? | 32 | 33
32 | You jog back to the ship, proud that you're making good time. But as soon as you can spot the glow of the ship's beacon, you hear a growl, and turn to spot a huge animal.\nEven though you try to sprint away as fast as you can, the creature scoops you into its gaping mouth, and you become its dinner. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | -1 | -1
33 | You discretely haul the apparatus you found in the direction of the ship. As you turn a corner, you encounter a huge animal, and you know you must be toast. But it doesn't\nimmediately attack, and from this distance, you can see that it doesn't have any eyes.\nQuietly, you tiptoe by and make it to the ship safely. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | 34 | 34
34 | Climbing into the ship and shutting the hydraulic door behind you, you breathe a sigh of relief and set the apparatus on the floor. Scanning its value, you find that its\nworth enough to meet your quota.\nYou pull the lever to take off, and your ship safely flies away. (type '1' or '2' to continue) | 35 | 35
